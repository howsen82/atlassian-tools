## An introduction to DevOps

### The CALMS/CALMR approach

John Willis and Damon Edwards were asked the same question about the burgeoning DevOps movement – how do we implement DevOps? In other words, what were the important factors for a successful DevOps implementation?

They came up with an acronym, **CAMS**, where each letter identified a key component for a successful DevOps approach. **C** stood for **Culture**, **A** represented **Automation**. **M** was for **Measurement**, and **S** stood for **Sharing**.

When writing in The *DevOps Handbook*, Jez Humble elaborated on the CAMS model. He added an **L**, which stood for **Lean**. With this addition, CAMS became **CALMS**.

Scaled Agile Inc., when adopting DevOps into the **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**, modified the approach. Reasoning that the ideal DevOps culture was one of shared responsibility, Scaled Agile removed the S for Sharing and replaced it with an **R**, which stood for **Recovery**. CALMS became **CALMR** when practicing DevOps in SAFe.

Let's take a look at each letter of the CALMS and CALMR approaches and see how they fit in with the adoption of Atlassian tools and the Open DevOps platform.

**Culture**

The management expert Peter Drucker is credited with saying, “*Culture eats strategy for breakfast*,” underlying the impact that culture, as a common thread, can have on uniting individuals in a group, from as small as a team, to as large as nations. So, if the correct culture can drive organizations to desired results, what is the correct culture? To find the answer, we turn to a sociologist named Ron Westrum.

In 1988, Ron Westrum organized a study to measure the safety of medical teams. He organized the teams into three different types of cultures:

> * Pathological
> * Bureaucratic
> * Generative

A pathological culture is one that's leader-driven. Motivation mainly comes through fear and threats from the leaders to accomplish the (leader's) goals.

A bureaucratic culture has safety mechanisms through rules and standards, but these can then be used to protect the members of the group from outsiders.

A generative culture, in contrast, is focused on aligning with a common mission. Information is freely shared with whomever, whether they are a member of the group or not, irrespective of whether they can play a role in the success of the mission.

Westrum found in his initial study that medical teams that possessed a generative culture also possessed alignment to their mission, an awareness of things that impeded the mission, and gave empowerment to any individual to make changes to remove those impediments. This allowed organizations to easily make long-lasting improvements to the system to improve the teams even more.

These benefits are not limited to medical teams. In the book *Accelerate – Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations*, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim investigated recommending DevOps practices to teams to see how effective they were. They surveyed development teams and found that those teams that had a generative culture produced higher levels of performance for software delivery and experienced higher levels of job satisfaction.

A change in culture, while possible, is typically the last change that occurs after structural and behavioral changes. Atlassian does provide tools that assist in the change of structure and behavior to move teams to a generative culture. These tools that assist cultural change are available for free as the Team Playbook (https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook). However, going into detail about these tools is beyond the scope of this book.

**Automation**

When people think of DevOps, the first thing that comes to mind is automation. In the talk given by Allspaw and Hammond at the O'Reilly Velocity 2009 conference, one of the key factors of success mentioned included the use of automated infrastructure and a common version control system for both development and operations.

These days, key automation is done by successfully linking tools together to form a toolchain. Each activity in development and operations has at least one tool associated with it.

A diagram that shows development activity with associated Atlassian tools is shown in the following figure:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_01.jpg)

This book will demonstrate in its chapters how to establish a toolchain with the Atlassian tools illustrated in the preceding figure.


**Lean**

The system created by automation can only work well if its demand does not exceed its capacity. To ensure this balance, we will look at applying lean thinking practices, initially developed as part of the Toyota Production System. Practices include the following:

> * Make all work visible
> * Limit the **Work-in-Progress (WIP)**
> * Keep batch sizes small
> * Monitor queues

We will see the relationships between the size of the work (the queue length), the time it takes to process the work (the cycle time), and how long until we see the results (the wait time) from queueing theory. A key formula in this is Little's law, expressed here:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/1.png)

*L* signifies the queue length. The Greek letter *lambda* represents the throughput the team has in processing the work. *W* represents the wait time for finished work.

An additional equation called Kingman's formula tells us that there's a direct correlation between the cycle time, utilization, and variability of the items of work the team must complete. This formula (often called the VUT equation) is shown here:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/2.png)

In this equation, E(W) represents the wait time. It is shown as equivalent to the product of *variability (V)*, *utilization (U)*, and *cycle time (T)*.

Jira has features that allow us to display the work to do through Kanban boards, also allowing us to limit the WIP through column constraints. Wait times and cycle times can also be calculated from the metrics collected.


**Measurement**

In judging the effectiveness of our efforts to develop, release, and maintain our products, we need to ask three key questions:

> * Are we on track to deliver the solution?
> * What is the health of all of our operating environments (test, stage, and production)?
> * Do our customers think we have developed the right solution?

We saw when looking at lean practices in the previous section that we needed to pay attention to the following metrics to evaluate whether we operate in a state of flow:

> * The cycle time
> * The WIP
> * The throughput
> * Any impediments or blockers to progress

In looking at the condition of the operating environments, we turn to the discipline of observability, where we collect all aspects of the environments from infrastructure to applications. The typical measurements for observability include the following:

> * Logs
> * Call/execution traces
> * Metrics

Measurements that can indicate whether our customers receive the proposed value from new product features can be tricky to determine. Vanity metrics may exist that occur naturally and indicate good trends, but after thorough analysis, they do not produce actionable answers. Metrics that have proven reliable in measuring customer sentiment include the following:

> * *Pirate* metrics (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue) devised by Dave McClure, a look at ideal customer behavior toward a product or feature, with measurements of that behavior
> * Google HEART Metrics, used by Google UI/UX to gauge user preferences in terms of Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task Success
> * **Fit for Purpose (F4P)** devised by David J. Anderson and Alexei Zheglov, which measures whether a customer's needs are met, as outlined in the book *Fit for Purpose – How Modern Businesses Find, Satisfy, and Keep Customers*.

Atlassian applications can collect the needed metrics or easily integrate with dedicated metric collection tools. Jira is a proven platform to collect the metrics needed for lean. Out-of-the-box reports, as well as the easy application of third-party marketplace apps, allow us to collect and analyze required metrics. Open DevOps allows easy integration with observability tools such as those offered by Datadog and New Relic.


**Sharing**

Once we have collected the measurements, we need a way of easily displaying the information to all who need it to foster a generative culture.

The Atlassian tools described in this book provide a good basis to foster information sharing and transparency. Jira can produce charts and reports that can be shared on a dashboard. Other displays related to application health can be collected and displayed using Compass.


**Recovery**

In any DevOps implementation, we want to devote time and attention to planning contingency steps to take if a release causes an outage in the production environment. DevOps changes the operating model where both development and operations, either acting together or with specialized site reliability engineers, must collaborate to answer the following questions:

> * How do we reduce the risk when we release?
> * What mitigation steps should be designed to limit the outage time, should it occur?
> * If an outage happens, what procedures should we follow?

Atlassian tools may form the answer to these problems. Feature flag tools such as those provided by LaunchDarkly, easily integrate with Jira through Open DevOps. Compass provides early warning capabilities if an outage appears imminent. Opsgenie allows development and operations to collaborate in an outage to bring about a swift resolution.

We have seen the key pillars of a DevOps approach and how the Atlassian tools help foster them. In the next section, let's examine the possible technologies that impact DevOps implementation and where Atlassian tools can help.

## Technology considerations for DevOps

The adoption of the DevOps approach was encouraged by emerging technologies that made it easier and faster to deploy, release, and maintain products. The changes in technology include the following:

* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines
* **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**
* Cloud environments
* Containers/Kubernetes


**CI/CD pipelines**

CI tools were often used to make a daily build or a build of software that gathered the commits of that day. After creating the build, the CI tools would run automated tests, and report the success or failure of that operation.

Allspaw and Hammond took their CI tool further. If a build passed all its tests, the CI tool would allow you to move the build artifacts to either a test or staging environment for further testing, or to the production environment to prepare for release or *go-live*.

The extension of CI came to be known as CD. Automating deployment by using a CI/CD tool allows for consistent deployments because steps aren't forgotten or skipped. Testing of deployment further ensures proper function and that the behavior seen is the desired behavior.

As tooling moved from just automated building to incorporating all steps of CI and CD from a single trigger, version control tools began to offer their own pipeline capabilities, controlled by a text file in the **YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)** format. This facilitated a mini-movement called GitOps where build, testing, integration, packaging, and deployment all started from a single Git commit as a trigger.


**IaC**

As CI expanded to include CD, deployment into environments was about to be made easier. New tools such as Ansible, Chef, Terraform, and Puppet allowed for the definition of an ideal infrastructure as specified by text files.

By running the infrastructure tools with the text files as input, there would be a consistent way of creating environments, whether they were used for testing, staging, or production. This consistency helped in keeping environments similar, ensuring the same testing results no matter which environment was used and preventing configuration drift, where problems were seen when environments weren't similar.


**Cloud environments**

While CI/CD pipelines and IaC tools could be applied to many physical platforms, from cyber-physical systems that became known as the Internet of Things (IoT) to physical servers, DevOps success has become associated most closely with the rise of cloud environments.

Cloud environments are created with virtual machines available from a vendor and are accessible through the Internet. Creation and disposal of the virtual machines can happen within minutes, allowing for dynamic and flexible setups that could be provisioned on demand.


**Containers and Kubernetes**

The popularity of cloud environments and IaC has encouraged further thought as to how to package a software application and propagate that to multiple test, staging, and production environments.

**Containers** have a long history as an approach to isolate processes and their resources, first in Unix and then in Linux. In 2013, Docker was the first company to introduce not only its standard of containers but also a way of managing them. The standard provided by Docker is the most prevalent one used today in describing, creating, and managing containers.

What is a container? If we start with the application we create and how its resources are allocated on a physical computer server, we can see that its code, libraries, and data occupy some of the server's memory, as illustrated in the following figure:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_2.jpg)<br>Figure – A packaged application in a physical server

Virtual machines allow a physical server to host multiple instances of **Virtual Machines (VMs)**. Each VM can have its own individual set of operating systems, applications, and accompanying libraries. The VMs are managed by a hypervisor, which is an application process run on the physical server. This arrangement is shown as follows:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_3.jpg)<br>Figure – VM and application packaging in a physical server

Docker or other container management systems allow for more efficient resource management. The container requires only resources for the application and any dependent third-party libraries. Any OS-level resources that are required are managed through a managing application. In Docker's case, the managing software is Docker Engine. This arrangement is outlined as follows:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_4.jpg)<br>Figure – Container and server packaging

Note that the server that hosts Docker Engine and its containers can be a physical server or a VM. This allows for portability, where the only artifact that can move from environment to environment is the definition of the container, known as the container image.

With the portability of containers, developers can create their application and deploy it into an artifact that can be version-controlled and easily transferred to testing or production. The application under development can be compartmentalized as a service.

Kubernetes emerged from Google in 2015 as a way of creating and managing clusters composed of containers. The clusters allowed for the dynamic creation of Pods from containers to make flexible and resilient services or microservices.

Now that we have seen the underlying tenets of DevOps and the main facets of technology that drive its acceptance and popularity, it's time to examine how the tools from Atlassian can form a toolchain for a DevOps approach.

# Creating an Open DevOps toolchain from scratch

### How to do it...

Let's go to the Atlassian website to create an Open DevOps environment with multiple connected tools:
1. Atlassian's Open DevOps solution is described at https://www.atlassian.com/solutions/devops. This site allows you to see what Open DevOps is, what third-party integrations make up part of the solution, and what DevOps best practices Open DevOps plays a role in.
2. From this page, you can request the creation of a new Atlassian Cloud site with the Jira product, installed by selecting the **Try for free** button on the page, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_5.jpg)<br>Figure – Atlassian's Open DevOps page with the Try it free button

3. The page will open, allowing you to connect an existing Bitbucket workspace or create a new one by typing its name. This panel is shown in the following screenshot:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_06.jpg)<br>Figure – Selecting a Bitbucket workspace

4. Create a new Bitbucket workspace to tie into your toolchain. This is the default option when creating a new toolchain. You can also select an existing Bitbucket workspace if you have one. After you've made your choice, select **Next**.

5. The next panel prompts you to name the new Atlassian Cloud suite. The text before **.atlassian.net** must be unique. This panel is depicted as follows:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_07.jpg)<br>Figure – Naming your Atlassian Cloud suite panel

6. Name your Atlassian Cloud site and press **Next**.
7. A new panel should indicate success, prompting you to go to Jira on your cloud site and create a project, as seen in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_08.jpg)<br>Figure – Open DevOps Site success panel

8. During the entire process, the panel has specified that no credit card is needed, and we haven't had to include payment information. What gets created on our Atlassian Cloud site are the free plans for Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket and the DevOps plan for Opsgenie, which is free for five users.

Following this recipe has allowed for the creation of an entire toolchain, starting with Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence, and Opsgenie.

## Creating an Atlassian Cloud site with Jira only

A more modular approach than creating an Atlassian Cloud site with multiple products can be to create a new Atlassian Cloud site and install Jira only. Other installations of other Atlassian products can be done on an as-needed basis.

To do this, we will go to a different landing page and follow the prompts, as seen in the following recipe steps.

### How to do it...

To install Jira only on a new Atlassian Cloud site, follow these alternate instructions:

1. Atlassian's product page for Jira is located at https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira. Select the **Get it free** button, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_09.jpg)<br>Figure – Selecting the free plan from the Jira Products page

2. On the next panel, if you're logged into an Atlassian account, it will reveal that account and prompt you to enter the name of the new Atlassian Cloud site.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_10.jpg)<br>Figure – Creating a new Atlassian Cloud site

3. As seen in the preceding figure, fill in the Atlassian account and the desired name for your Cloud site and click **Agree**.

Following the instructions will create an Atlassian Cloud site with the name you have specified, granting you administrator privileges. The next section looks at the scenario where you have to create an Atlassian account if you don't have one.

### There's more...

If you don't have an Atlassian account or haven't logged into your Atlassian account, you will be taken to a different page to create a free Atlassian account:

1. You can enter a work email or use common accounts with OpenID service providers, such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, or Slack.
2. Once the account is created, Atlassian will prompt you to create an Atlassian Cloud site with a free plan of Jira installed, as seen before.

---

## Creating a Jira project

So far, you have created an Atlassian Cloud site with only Jira or Jira with Confluence, and connections to Opsgenie and Bitbucket.

We will start the process of creating our toolchain by setting up the Jira projects that will use the toolchain. Let's look at doing this now.

### How to do it...

In the following steps, you will create a Jira project that not only captures the work done by the development team but allows integrations with artifacts from other tools:

1. Go to the Atlassian Cloud site you created in the previous recipes in this chapter. You may be prompted to create the site's first Jira project by selecting a project template, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_11.jpg)<br>Figure – Selecting a project template

2. Select a project template that matches the Agile methodology your team wants to practice (**KANBAN** or **SCRUM**) and press **Next**.

Tip

In general, teams that look to develop on a cadence with frequent stakeholder feedback opt for Scrum, and teams that look to monitor and track a steady flow of work will choose a Kanban project.

3. The following page allows you to select other options, such as a name and whether the project is company-managed or team-managed. Company-managed Jira projects will have project elements such as custom fields, workflows, notifications, and permissions set up by Jira administrators. Team-managed projects allow all customizations to be done by team administrators, but these changes are only available to the project:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_12.jpg)<br>Figure – Creating Jira project details

4. If you created an Open DevOps platform on your Atlassian Cloud site, it would automatically create the other artifacts such as Confluence spaces, Bitbucket repositories, and Opsgenie teams. The next panel, as depicted in the following figure, shows this:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_13.jpg)<br>Figure – The open DevOps artifacts created

5. If you created an Atlassian Cloud site with only Jira, you won't see the preceding screen (don't worry; we'll show you how to connect the other tools in other recipes in this chapter). Instead, you will see other tools you can connect to your Jira project, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_14.jpg)<br>Figure – Connecting other tools

6. You can select the tools to connect and press **Next** to integrate with other tools or select **Skip** to do the integrations later.

By following the preceding steps, you should have a Jira project ready to connect to the necessary tools by means of the Issues or work artifacts, stored in Jira.

The following recipes allow you to make connections when the Open DevOps platform wasn't selected to create the Atlassian Cloud site, or when the Jira product and projects were already created.

---

## Connecting Confluence

Confluence is Atlassian's second-oldest tool. Previously, it has complemented Jira as the repository of documentation artifacts for development activities recorded in Jira.

Confluence works by organizing individual pages into **spaces**. Spaces can be set up for any number of purposes, such as a knowledge base or product documentation.

The first step will be to add Confluence to the Atlassian Cloud site. Once added, a new space can be created for the new Jira project.

### Getting ready

Different administrators set up different things for Confluence. Let's take a brief look at the various levels of administration for Atlassian Cloud.

Organization administrators are responsible for the overall organization and the Atlassian Cloud sites contained within. They set up users to access specific Atlassian products and add products to Atlassian Cloud sites.

Confluence administrators are responsible for creating the spaces on an instance of Confluence and managing the permissions of users for those spaces, based on roles.

We will identify what level of administration is needed for each part of this recipe.

### How to do it...

We will approach this recipe in two parts – the first part is where we add Confluence to the Atlassian Cloud site that also has Jira. The second part of this recipe is creating a Confluence space and connecting it to a Jira project.

Adding Confluence to the Atlassian Cloud site
Let's look at adding Confluence to the same Atlassian Cloud site where we added Jira only in the Creating a new Atlassian Cloud site with Jira only recipe:

1. As the Organization admin, go to https://start.atlassian.com to find the Switcher icon in the top-left corner.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_15.jpg)<br>Figure – Switching Atlassian applications on the start page

2. Clicking on the icon, as seen in the preceding figure, reveals the application options. Select **More Atlassian products**, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_16.jpg)<br>Figure – Selecting the Atlassian product

3. On the page that opens, look for the option for Confluence and press **Try it now**.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_17.jpg)<br>Figure – Trying Confluence

4. Type in the site name where you want to add Confluence and select **Continue**, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_18.jpg)<br>Figure – Add Confluence to a site

The results of these instructions should be the Confluence product added to your Atlassian Cloud site.

Now, let's take a look at filling Confluence with data, in the form of spaces and pages.

Creating a Confluence space and connecting it to the Jira project
Let's start adding data to Confluence by creating our first space:

1. As an organization admin or a Confluence admin, from the **Home** selection on the menu bar, click on the **+** symbol in the **SPACES** section, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_19.jpg)<br>Figure – Selecting + to create a space

2. On the following page, select a space template or leave it as a **Blank** template. Click **Next**.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_20.jpg)<br>Figure – Selecting a Confluence template

3. Give the template a name. You can also specify the space's key. Click on **Create space** to complete the process.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_21.jpg)<br>Figure – Completing the space creation

4. As a Jira project admin, Jira admin, or organization admin, navigate to the desired Jira project. Select Project pages. Then, select Connect to Confluence or use the arrow icons to view the Confluence spaces or pages you want to connect.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_22.jpg)<br>Figure – Connecting the Confluence space

5. Select the space created and click **Connect**, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_23.jpg)<br>Figure – Completing the connection to a space

You have successfully connected Confluence to Jira by defining a space and linking it to the project.

---

## Connecting Bitbucket

Currently, Bitbucket maintains a separate location from the other tools at the Atlassian Cloud site, at https://bitbucket.org. On Bitbucket, there are by default administrators and users in a developers group.

On the Bitbucket side, a member of the Administrators group must create the repository or repo. This repo may be grouped within other repositories in a Bitbucket project. The top level in Bitbucket is a workspace. This may be analogous to the top level of an organization.

On the Jira side, we need a Jira Project admin to connect the repository to the Jira project.

Let’s take a look at the steps involved.

### How to do it...

Let’s look at the steps involved in connecting Bitbucket.

Creating a repository in Bitbucket
Implement the following steps to create a repository in Bitbucket:

1. As a Bitbucket administrator, select the **Repositories** menu bar and click the **Create repository** button.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_24.jpg)<br>Figure – Creating a Bitbucket repository

2. In the page that follows, fill in the repository name and select the project for the repo (these are the only mandatory items) and other desired details. Click the Create repository button when finished.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_25.jpg)<br>Figure – Completing the repository creation

Now that we have a Bitbucket repository, let’s connect it to a Jira project.

Connecting a repository to a Jira project
Follow these steps to integrate Bitbucket data from the repository into a Jira project:

1. As a Jira admin, from the Jira project, select **Project settings** from the options on the left.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_26.jpg)<br>Figure – Selecting Project settings

2. Select **Development tools**, as shown in the following figure:
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_27.jpg)<br>Figure – Selecting Development tools

3. By default, Bitbucket is shown to be connected to Jira on the **Development tools** page. We can make adjustments to the connection by selecting the **Connect** pulldown and choosing **Bitbucket Cloud** from the options.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_28.jpg)<br>Figure – Connect Bitbucket Cloud

4. In the **Jira requests access** page, authorize Jira to access the Bitbucket workspace where you created the repo by selecting the workspace and clicking **Grant Access**.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_29.jpg)<br>Figure – Grant Bitbucket workspace access to Jira

5. On the **DVCS accounts** page, select the repository or repositories to allow **Smart Commits**, and then click the **Link Bitbucket Cloud workspace** button.
   
   ![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835463789/graphics/image/B21937_01_30.jpg)<br>Figure – Add Repository and Link Bitbucket Cloud workspace

By connecting a Bitbucket repository to a Jira project, as you did by following the preceding instructions, you connect the reason for doing the work (the why) with the implementation of the work (the how).
